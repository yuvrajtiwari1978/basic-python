# Basic Python Repository

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programming examples demonstrating fundamental concepts without using functions. The examples are organized into separate files as follows:

- `operators.py`: Demonstrates different types of Python operators including:
  - Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
  - Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
  - Logical operators: and, or, not
  - Assignment operators: =, +=, *=
  - Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

- `loops.py`: Shows examples of loops in Python:
  - `for` loop iterating over a range
  - `while` loop with a counter

- `if_else_elif.py`: Contains examples of conditional statements using:
  - `if` statement to check positive number
  - `elif` statement to check zero
  - `else` statement to check negative number
  - Another example classifying age groups with if-elif-else

- `palindrome.py`: Checks if a given string is a palindrome using string slicing (`[::-1]`).

- `armstrong.py`: Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number by summing the cubes of its digits and comparing with the original number.

- Additional files (if any) demonstrate other basic Python concepts such as list comprehensions, error handling, classes, and more.

Each file contains simple, straightforward code to help beginners understand basic Python programming constructs without using functions.
